Fall Colors

Green, Red, Orange and Yellow leaves
Fall from the sky
The scent of Fall consumes you

Feel the swaying wind
It races ever faster... riding clouds across the sky
Peaceful as flowers blooming in Spring

The sun peeks through the mists
As a rainbow slashes through the grey curtains of a thunderstorm's heart
Bliss... interrupted

Strolling through the timber on your serene journey
The flute-like lilt of a bird's symphony captures your ears and eyes
Its sound.  Alluring.  Soothing.  Calming.

Through darkest cracks of grey, azure ribbons tear
A crescendo of peace and tranquility
Fall colors... illuminated

What mystery lies on the wind once this peace, this Fall is gone?
'tis only Winter... Fall's equal in beauty... a study in white and wonder
